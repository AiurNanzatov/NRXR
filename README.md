Two-step Authentication in VR using NRXR

This project implements an approach to two-step authentication by "splitting" the password authentication process between two independent devices. In this method, one half of the password is displayed on a smartphone screen, while the other half is delivered through a head-mounted device (HMD). This design ensures that only an individual with access to both devices can successfully combine the two halves to form the complete password.
